# How have requirements been met. 

### Timeline within the game
### Build timeline to display to the user as they progress through each mini game (based on user speed of game completion to ensure full timeline is displayed to every user
###  Build timeline in Unity using assets from ‘Wooden GUI’ pack

### Define mini games x 4

#### Mini game 1: British Countryside – Beef
#### A Snake style maze game in which the player must move their character to eat the vegetables and avoid the beef.

#### Mini game 2: Ocean – Plastic Bottles
#### A basketball style game in which the player must throw plastic bottles into the recycling bin.

#### Mini game 3: Rainforest – Mobile Phone
#### A collection style game in which working mobile phones, and broken mobile phones fall from the top of the screen where the player must catch the broken phones in the recycling bin, and working phones into the backpack.

#### Mini game 4: Arctic – Leaving electronic devices on standby
#### A game in which players must unplug and turn off switches for electronic devices.

### As a game player, I want to learn what I can do to help minimise greenhouse gases so that I can implement these actions in my everyday life.
### Obtain a list of predefined pledges from ZSL
#### Mobile phone  
##### I will reconsider upgrading my phone every year/two years if it still works okay (REASON: Less new mobile phones will be needed so fewer raw materials will be sourced and made into new phones)
##### I will take care of my phone to make it last as long as possible (REASON: Less new mobile phones will be needed so fewer raw materials will be sourced and made into new phones)
##### I will recycle my phone instead of throwing it in landfill (REASON: The recycled parts can be used in new phones, so less raw materials need to be sourced)
 
#### Plastic bottle
 
##### I will use a reusable bottle instead of buying single use plastic bottles (REASON: Less single use plastic bottles will be needed and made)
##### I will recycle any plastic bottles I use (REASON: The plastic can be reused to make new bottles; and throwing plastic into landfill releases methane into the atmosphere)
##### If I want water when eating out, I will ask for tap water instead of getting it in a plastic bottle (REASON: Less single use plastic bottles will be needed and made)
 
#### Beef

##### I will try to skip eating beef (and better yet, meat!) for one day a week (you could follow @meatfreemonday) (REASON: Less beef/meat will be farmed)
##### If I have access to a special food waste bin, I will throw beef (and any other food waste) in it (REASON: Throwing food waste into landfill releases methane into the atmosphere)
##### When ordering food I will pick an alternative meat (or better yet, a vegetarian option) instead of beef (REASON: Less beef/meat will be farmed)
 
#### Electronics on standby

##### I will switch electronics off of standby when I am not using them (REASON: Less electricity will be needed and therefore less carbon released into the atmosphere)
##### I will switch light switches off when I am not using them (REASON: Less electricity will be needed and therefore less carbon released into the atmosphere)
##### I will unplug my mobile phone charger from the wall (REASON: even when a phone is not attached to a charger that’s switched on at the wall, it uses electricity!)
